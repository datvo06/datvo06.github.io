### Short bio  
I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** with [Harvard’s Programming Languages and Formal Methods groups](https://pl.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Basis Research Institute](https://www.basis.ai/about/).

I submitted my PhD thesis at the [University of Melbourne](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), where I built neuro‑symbolic techniques that uses graph-based representation for neural networks for program analysis. Earlier, I spent 4 years at **Cinnamon AI Lab** working on visually rich document information extraction.

I enjoy building learning‑aware tools that treat code as both data and logic. My work lies at the intersection of software engineering, programming languages, and machine learning, coupling **graph-based representation, large language models, and symbolic reasoning** to make software development and formal proof more reliable and automated.

At Harvard, I am extending these ideas to proof automation in **Lean** and discovering drug repurposing candidates.
At Basis, I am working on two projects: [MARA](https://www.basis.ai/blog/mara/) and [R-ADA](https://www.basis.ai/our-work/r-ada/)

### Research interests  
- Graph‑based analyses for code and proofs  
- Large language models as abstraction engines for program & proof synthesis  
- Neuro‑symbolic methods that couple **Graphs, Neural Networks, SMT, and LLMs**  
- Explainability & robustness for ML models on code  

Recent highlights:  
* **VRDSynth for visually rich documents** (ISSTA ’24) [oai_citation:8‡ISSTA 2024](https://2024.issta.org/details/issta-2024-papers/57/VRDSynth-Synthesizing-Programs-for-Multilingual-Visually-Rich-Document-Information-E)  
* **GNN‑based fault localisation** (ICSME ’22) [oai_citation:6‡SOAR](https://soarsmu.github.io/papers/2022/ICSME_FFL.pdf)
